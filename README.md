# Aleatoric Luck: Zheng–Cheng Predictive Approach

This is an independent research implementation inspired by Zheng and Cheng's
predictive approach to social rigidity. The first complete case study predicts
the Fragile Families Challenge Year 15 `materialHardship` outcome from ICPSR
31622 DS15 Challenge files.

The target is treated as a continuous proportion score. The main evaluation
metric is holdout MSE, and learning curves are fit with a power-law form to
estimate a model-, feature-, split-, and extrapolation-conditional error-floor
proxy:

```text
E(n) = c * n^(-alpha) + epsilon
```

`epsilon` should not be interpreted as model-independent Bayes aleatoric
uncertainty.

## Data

The framework expects a local ICPSR 31622 DS15 download. It does not log into
ICPSR and does not reconstruct Year 15 labels from questionnaire items.

The included portable configuration expects the following files under
`data/ds15/` (data are not included in this repository):

- `background.csv` for Challenge features
- `train.csv` for training labels
- `test.csv` for final holdout truth
- `materialHardship` as the target

Rows where the truth file has non-missing `materialHardship` define the final
holdout for this outcome.

## Workflow

Run the full local DS15 workflow with:

```bash
python -m ffcws_predict audit-features --config configs/material_hardship.yaml
python -m ffcws_predict prepare --config configs/material_hardship.yaml
python -m ffcws_predict train --config configs/material_hardship.yaml
python -m ffcws_predict learning-curve --config configs/material_hardship.yaml
python -m ffcws_predict summarize --config configs/material_hardship.yaml
```

Core outputs are written to `runs/material_hardship/` and are ignored by Git:

- `feature_dictionary_resolved.csv`
- `prepared_material_hardship.csv`
- `preprocessing_report.json`
- `model_metrics.csv`
- `holdout_predictions.csv`
- `prediction_range_diagnostics.csv`
- `imputation_comparison.json`
- `imputation_prediction_differences.csv`
- `learning_curve.csv`
- `power_law_fit.csv`
- `summary_report.md`

## Feature Dictionary

`configs/feature_dictionary_material_hardship_v1.csv` is a hand-built domain
dictionary with exact DS15 `background.csv` column names. The domains are:

- `family_economics`
- `employment`
- `housing`
- `program_participation`
- `family_structure`
- `parent_health`
- `social_support`
- `neighborhood`
- `child_early_status`

Duplicate cross-domain columns are de-duplicated for modeling and marked as
`cross_domain` in the resolved dictionary.

## Models

The training command evaluates:

- mean baseline
- OLS
- Ridge
- Lasso
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

Linear models use imputation, missingness indicators, and standardization.
Tree models use imputation without standardization.

For XGBoost and LightGBM, the pipeline also runs a robustness check comparing:

- `median`: median imputation plus missingness indicators
- `native_nan`: special missing codes converted to `NaN`, no median imputation,
  no missingness indicators

## Tests

The tests use Python's standard `unittest` runner:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Syntax checking:

```bash
python -m compileall ffcws_predict tests
```
